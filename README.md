# CI2024_lab1

In this lab the problem was approached tith the "Random mutation hill climber" algorithm.

This algorithm in insance 1 gives the best result because of it's semplicity.

For Istance 2 and 3 the algorithm gives a local optimal, but we are not sure that it gives the best solution (most likely it won't).

For istance 4, 5 and 6 i used a bigger tweak because it gave a slightly better solution. Still it isn't the best solution for the same reason of istance
2 and 3, and for the limited number of steps.

At istance 5 we would expect half the cost of the optimal solution compared to the previous istance. But the limited number of steps
didn't gave the possibility to expore further solutions.

At istance 6 the number of steps was incriased from 1000 to 200000 and we can see a great improvement of the fitness.
